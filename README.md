Based on the principles and best practices discussed throughout this course, you are asked to build a
dynamic website for a restaurant of choice. This website should provide:
a) generic information about the restaurant (including address and opening hours),
b) information about the people running it,
c) a way to allow users to contact the restaurant (to book a table, send a query or file a
complaint),
d) information about the current menu being served at the restaurant (i.e. list of dishes) and
e) a detailed description of each item on the menu (on a separate page from the list provided
in d). 
f) users should be able to add individual dishes to a “favourites” list (from within the dish
details page),
g) which list can then be accessed from a dedicated page, listing all the marked dishes (and
their details), while allowing users to remove dishes from the list or send the entire list to an
email address of their choice.


The menu page as well as menu-item detail pages, should be dynamically generated based on a
separate structured data file or a simple database containing a hierarchal representation of dishes
served by the restaurant. XML, CSV, as well as relational databases, are all acceptable formats to
represent the necessary data structure (as shown below). This strategy would allow non-technical
users to modify their site content independently.
