## Talking points/TODOS for next meeting
* Think about the color scheme, at the moment we're going to get dinged for accessability. Looks clean though. [KATIA]
* Need to be able to send an email of the favorites [LARS]
* Need Documentation [ALL][Lars Starts]


for the email, just format the html page and send it as an email, and all we need is to have a list of the meal names.
